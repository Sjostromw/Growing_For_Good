The only files in the repo are the scripts to create (or drop/create) the GrowingForGood database. 

I have made some changes to my version of the database so if you want yours to look the same you will need to run the 'DROP and CREATE GrowingForGood' script. If you run the 'CREATE GrowingForGood' script, it will kick lots of errors and will probably create a lot of duplicate data. In order to update the whole database at one time, you will need to drop the entire database then create it with the different code (exactly what the DROP and CREATE script is designed to do)
